# odin-landing-page

I have used CSS and Flexbox to create a beautiful landing page for
a made up business.

I will be building the CSS on top of the foundations that I've learned
from HTML.

The CSS I use showcases basic use of classes and manipulating of selectors,
use of color, text, margin, padding, border, width and height properties,
structuring my webpage using HTML and Flexbox. I use Flexbox extensively
to layout various sections on my webpage and my familiarity of the Flexbox
properties allow me to easily set the layout for my webpage.
